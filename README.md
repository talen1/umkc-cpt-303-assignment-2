# Single Linked List and Employee Hierarchy C++ Program

This C++ program includes two parts:

1. Single Linked List Implementation: This part of the program provides a basic implementation of a single linked list with various operations like push, pop, insert, remove, and search.

2. Employee Hierarchy: This part defines an abstract class Employee and two derived classes Professional and Nonprofessional. It showcases an example of object-oriented programming principles in C++.

# How to Run the Code

1. Compilation: To compile the code, ensure you have a C++ compiler installed (e.g., g++). Navigate to the directory containing the code files and open a terminal.

2. Compile the Code:

# For the Single Linked List part:

 g++ -o main Single_Linked_List.cpp main.cpp

# For the Employee Hierarchy part:
 g++ -o main Employee.cpp main.cpp

3. Run the Executable:
 ./main

The program will run and demonstrate the functionality of the Single Linked List and the Employee hierarchy.
